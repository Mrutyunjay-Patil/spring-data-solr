# Spring Data Solr Project

This project is an updated version of Spring Data Solr, aimed at providing support for Spring Boot 3.x. The original Spring Data Solr project, at version 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT, did not officially support Spring Boot 3.x. This update brings the project to version 5.0.0, ensuring compatibility and enabling developers to leverage the latest features of Spring Boot along with Spring Data Solr.

## Project Background

Spring Data Solr is a part of the larger Spring Data project which aims to simplify data access within the Spring application framework. Due to the evolving nature of Spring Boot, certain versions of Spring Data Solr were left without support for newer releases of Spring Boot. Recognizing the need for continued support and compatibility, this project was initiated to bridge that gap.

## Key Features

- **Spring Boot 3.x Compatibility**: This project is tailored to work seamlessly with Spring Boot 3.x, ensuring that developers can continue to use Spring Data Solr with the latest Spring Boot features and improvements.
- **Updated Dependencies**: All dependencies within the project have been updated to their latest compatible versions to ensure smooth integration and enhanced performance.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Efforts have been made to maintain backward compatibility with existing Spring Data Solr functionalities, ensuring a smooth transition for existing projects.

## Getting Started

To use this updated Spring Data Solr project in your Spring Boot 3.x application, include the custom-built JAR file in your project dependencies. Ensure that your project's build tool configuration is updated to recognize this custom JAR as a part of your project's dependencies.
